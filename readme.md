# Wordometer 2, for Movable Type 4.x

This is an update to Wordometer: http://www.eatdrinksleepmovabletype.com/plugins/wordometer/

One new feature: visit the plugin's Settings to set a minimum and maximum word count highlight of the Body and Extended fields. This is particularly helpful when you want to write a lead-in in your Body of, say, roughly 100 words. The highlighter could be set to between 75 and 125 words as sort of a "goal" area.
